# Leaf-Disease-Detection

Hello everyone!
We have created a GUI for plant Leaf Disease Detection that determines whether a leaf is healthy or not. If unhealthy, it will predict and print the disease of the leaf in our GUI. 
We have used CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) along with tensorflow for image classification
